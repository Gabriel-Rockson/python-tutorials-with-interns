Assignment on Classes
-----------------------
To execute this assignment, create your own branch with name of branch
in the format: `feature/bank-account-application-{initials of developer's name}`
-> Name your files in this format: {my_name}-bank-app.py


1. Create a class called Account with the following attributes:
    account_number (string)
    balance (float)

Include a constructor that initializes these attributes.

2 Create a class called SavingsAccount that inherits from the Account class. Add the following attributes:
    interest_rate (float)
    minimum_balance (float)

Include a constructor that calls the parent constructor (Account) and sets the interest_rate and minimum_balance attributes.

3. Create a class called CheckingAccount that also inherits from the Account class. Add the following attributes:
    transaction_limit (integer)
    transaction_fee (float)

Include a constructor that calls the parent constructor (Account) and sets the transaction_limit and transaction_fee attributes.

4 Create a method in the Account class called display_balance() that prints out the current balance of the account.

5. Implement the following methods in the SavingsAccount class:
    apply_interest(): This method should calculate and add the interest to the account balance based on the interest rate.
    withdraw(amount): This method should allow withdrawing funds from the account. Check if the balance will fall below 
    the minimum balance after the withdrawal. If so, print a warning message and do not perform the withdrawal.

6. Implement the following methods in the CheckingAccount class:
    withdraw(amount): This method should allow withdrawing funds from the account. If the withdrawal amount exceeds the transaction limit,
    deduct the transaction fee from the account balance. 
    deposit(amount): This method should allow depositing funds into the account.

7. Create instances of the SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount classes, providing appropriate values for each attribute.

Call the display_balance() method for each account to show their current balance.
